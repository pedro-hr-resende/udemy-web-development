# Web development course (Udemy)

<p align="justify">
I decided to improve my web development skills, so I started a course at Udemy. The name of course is "Desenvolvimento Web Completo 2022 - 20 cursos + 20 projetos", by instructors Jorge Sant' Ana and Jamilton Damasceno. This repository contains all the code I wrote in classes. The technologies I have learned so far are:

<ul>
  <li> HTML5
  <li> CSS3
</ul>
