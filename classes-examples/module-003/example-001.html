           <u>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</u> Lorem 
           Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
           printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <strong>It
           has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
           remaining essentially unchanged.</strong> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
           of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
           software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <p align="justify">
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content
            of a page when looking at its layout. <em>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has
            a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
            here', making it look like readable English.</em> Many desktop publishing packages and
            web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
            ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <strike>Various versions have
            evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and
            the like).</strike>
